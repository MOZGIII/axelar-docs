# Become an Amplifier Verifier (Worker)

import { Callout } from "/src/components/callout"

<Callout>
The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.
</Callout>

By running a **verifier** (also called a **worker**) for a chain integration with Axelar, you will be responsible for voting on the validity of transactions on the Axelar network and signing command batches for a given chain.

## Prerequisites

1. Run tofnd: ampd needs access to a running tofnd instance in order to onboard as a worker or run the daemon. See the [tofnd repository](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/tofnd) for more info.

2. Download ampd: [binary](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v0.1.0) or [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/axelarnet/axelar-ampd)
3. Dowload ampd config: 

//TODO: host the config file with updated devnet urls and contract address

Dowload [config.toml](place holder) and put it in `~/.ampd/`.

By default, ampd loads the config file from `~/.ampd/config.toml` when running any command. This can be overridden by passing `--config [path]`.

## Verifier Onboarding

Prior to running the ampd daemon, workers need to perform the following onboarding steps.

1. Query your verifier address

```bash
ampd worker-address
```

2. Fund your verifier address. This can be achieved in a number of ways and is dependent on the environment (mainnet, testnet or devnet)

For devnet, join Axelarâ€™s Discord and get the Developer Role.

Go to the #faucet channel and submit a request with your account to get 100 test tokens.
```bash
!faucet devnet axelar1suw3fsckht00c5srgtr8p6lhn58e9lxq9yf5th
```

3. Bond your verifier:

```bash
ampd bond-worker [service name] [amount] [denom]
```

Bonded verifiers will stay bonded until they unbond, or are removed by governance.

4. Register your public key:

```bash
ampd register-public-key
```

5. Register support for desired chains. This enables ampd to participate in voting and signing for the specified chains. 
Multiple chain names can be passed, separated by a space.

```bash
ampd register-chain-support [service name] [chains]...
```

6. Authorize your verifier. 

This is dependent on the environment, and can be done via governance, or by the network operators.


For devnet, create an issue on [Axelar Support](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/support) ask your address to be whitelisted.

## Run the daemon

```bash
ampd
```

A state file will be created if it doesn't yet exist. The default location of the state file is ~/.ampd/state.json, which can be overridden by passing --state [path].


## Productionizing
You should now switch to running your own full Axelar node and your own full node for any chains you are voting on.
